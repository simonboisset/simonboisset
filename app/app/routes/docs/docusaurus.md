  title: Create multiple docs with Docusaurus
  description: Isn't this just awesome?
---

## Introduction

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is an open source framework developed by Facebook and based on react. It allows you to create clean, versionable and multilingual documentation with a very small configuration.

## Create your project

Like a create-react-app you can initialize your project with the following command:

```sh
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic --typescript
```

You can then start your development mode.

```sh
cd my-website
yarn start
```

## Project structure

In the same philosophy as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) you will be able to generate a static site based on markdown files but you can also create pages directly in jsx.

:::tip Docs file
The docs file contains all the chapters of your documentation. We will see how to configure it to have two distinct documentations.

## Create a second documentation

### Docusaurus Config

We want to create two documentations, one `Guide` and the other `Api`.
We will add an item in the navbar configuration.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
navbar: {
    {
        type: 'doc',
        docId: 'guide/intro',
        position: 'left',
        label: 'Docs',
    },
    {
        type: 'doc',
        docId: 'api/intro',
        position: 'left',
        label: 'Api',
    },
}
```

### Sidebars

We modify the Sidebars to include the two documentation and set their `dirName` to subfolders that we will create in the `docs` folder.

```js title="sidebars.js"
module.exports = {
  docSidebar: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'guide' }],
  apiSidebar: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'api' }],
};
```

### Writing documentation

Now you have to create two folders `docs/guide` and `docs/api` in which you can create your two documentations.

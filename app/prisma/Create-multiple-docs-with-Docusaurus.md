# Create multiple docs with Docusaurus

## Introduction

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is an open source framework developed by Facebook and based on react. It allows you to create clean, versionable and multilingual documentation with a very small configuration.

## Create your project

Like a create-react-app you can initialize your project with the following command:

```bash
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic --typescript
```

You can then start your development mode.

```bash
cd my-websiteyarn start
```

## Project structure

In the same philosophy as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) you will be able to generate a static site based on markdown files but you can also create pages directly in jsx.

> Docs file The docs file contains all the chapters of your documentation. We will see how to configure it to have two distinct documentations.
> 

## Create a second documentation

### Docusaurus Config

We want to create two documentations, one `Guide` and the other `Api`. We will add an item in the navbar configuration.

```jsx
navbar: 
{     
	{
		type: 'doc',
		docId: 'guide/intro',
		position: 'left',
		label: 'Docs',
	},
	{
		type: 'doc',
		docId: 'api/intro',
		position: 'left',
		label: 'Api',
	},
}
```

### Sidebars

We modify the Sidebars to include the two documentation and set their `dirName` to subfolders that we will create in the `docs` folder.

```jsx
module.exports = {
	docSidebar: [{ 
		type: 'autogenerated',
		dirName: 'guide' 
	}],
	apiSidebar: [{ 
		type: 'autogenerated',
		dirName: 'api' 
	}],
};
```

### Writing documentation

Now you have to create two folders `docs/guide` and `docs/api` in which you can create your two documentations.
